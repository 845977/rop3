    '''
    The Galileo algorithm.

    Introduced by Hovav Shacham in "The Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone:
    Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86)" (ACM CCS 2007, S 3.2,
    where he names it *Galileo*), this is the backward walk that underpins
    essentially every ROP gadget finder. Instead of disassembling forward from
    an entry point, it anchors on the bytes that *end* a gadget -- a `ret`, or
    any free-branch termination -- and disassembles backward from each such
    byte, trying every possible starting offset. On a variable-length, unaligned
    ISA a single `ret` is the tail of many distinct gadgets depending on where
    decoding begins, so the walk enumerates them all up to a bounded length.

    `alignment` collapses the "try every offset" step to the instruction
    alignment (1 on x86; 2 or 4 on RISC-V), and `terminations` carries the
    arch-specific byte patterns that end a gadget.

    Parameters
    ----------
    opcodes : bytes           -- executable bytes to scan.
    base_vaddr : int          -- virtual address of ``opcodes[0]``.
    terminations : iterable of {'bytes': <byte regex>, 'size': <int>}
                              -- gadget-terminating byte patterns and lengths.
    depth : int               -- maximum gadget length in bytes.
    alignment : int           -- instruction alignment in bytes.
    disasm : callable(raw, vaddr) -> iterable  -- e.g. capstone ``Cs.disasm``.
    is_valid_gadget : callable(decodes) -> bool -- gadget validity.
    accept_match : callable(ref) -> bool, optional -- filter on the
        termination's end offset (used to partition parallel chunks).
    accept_candidate : callable(vaddr, raw) -> bool, optional -- drop bad-char
        addresses/bytes before disassembly.

    A frame-establishing return (e.g. RISC-V `ret`, which jumps to whatever is
    in `ra`) only yields a useful gadget if the run first reloads the return
    target from the (attacker-controlled) stack. This specialization of the
    aligned sweep keeps exactly those: it anchors on each return terminator,
    walks backward over the intended instructions up to `depth`, and emits a
    gadget only once the run contains a frame load. A single boolean carried
    across the backward walk records whether such a load has been seen -- once
    true it stays true for every longer gadget, so the check is O(1) per
    candidate rather than a re-scan.

    Non-return terminators (indirect JOP branches, when enabled) carry no such
    requirement and are emitted as usual.

    Parameters mirror `aligned_scan`, plus:

        restores the return target from the stack (RISC-V `ld ra, off(sp)`).

    Backward framed ("ropblock") gadget search.

    A ropblock gadget is framed as ``[prologue] ... [terminator]``: the
    terminator writes the program counter from a register (an indirect
    ``jmp``/``br`` through a register), and the prologue loads *that* register
    from the stack (``pop reg`` / ``ldr reg, [sp]``). x86 ``ret`` is the
    degenerate case -- it pops the program counter straight off the stack, so a
    single instruction is both prologue and epilogue (``branch_reg`` returns
    ``None`` and the frame is satisfied with no separate prologue).

    Using `backward_instructions` to find each terminator, the search walks back
    over the contiguous runs that end at that terminator (growing one length at a
    time up to `depth` bytes) and emits a run once it is *framed*: it contains,
    before the terminator, a prologue that loads the terminator's branch register
    with no intervening clobber of that register. Longer runs that still contain
    the frame keep being emitted.

    Each emitted run carries a per-instruction ``frame`` mask (a tuple[bool]
    parallel to ``decodes``): True where the instruction is a framing
    prologue/epilogue rather than the operation body. It marks the data-flow
    prologue (the stack load of the branch register) and the terminator, plus any
    position-independent framing instruction `is_frame` recognizes (a prologue
    prefix, ...). Operation matching skips these.

    Predicates (arch-derived, passed as callables):
      is_terminator(insn)     -> bool   -- a ropblock terminator (pc <- reg / ret)
      branch_reg(insn)        -> reg | None -- register the terminator branches
          through, or None when the terminator is its own prologue (x86 ret)
      is_prologue(insn, reg)  -> bool   -- does `insn` load `reg` from the stack
      clobbers(insn, reg)     -> bool   -- does `insn` overwrite `reg`
      is_frame(insn)          -> bool, optional -- a position-independent framing
          instruction (prologue prefix / terminator). A stack
          pivot (`add rsp, 8`, `leave`) is *not* framing -- it is a real stack
          operation (control flow returns through the stack or a branch register,
          never through the pivot), so `is_frame` must exclude it. Default: none.
      splits(insn)            -> bool, optional -- an instruction that may not
          appear *inside* a gadget (an intermediate branch/return); a candidate
          whose body contains one is rejected. Default: no such check.
